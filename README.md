### Travel Wire

Your connection to cheap flights and inspiration-based travel.

### Concept

Many travel sites, such as skyscanner/priceline/google, have robust and existing ways of finding the cheapest flights from point A or to point B. Leveraging the Amadeus cheap flight API, Travelwire is a inspiration-travel web app that focuses on finding the cheapest flights that fit your time criteria with an unknown and potentially suprising destination. This could serve the population that wants to get away on a budget, or just looking for ways/reasons to travel spontaneously.

### Running the app

<pre>
    REACT_APP_AMADEUS_KEY=XXX
    REACT_APP_AMADEUS_SECRET=XXX
</pre>
